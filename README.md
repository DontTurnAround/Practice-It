# Practice-It 2.0

This repository exists as a failed project. I was attempting to make my own version of [Practice-It](https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu)
, a website run by the University of Washington to assist its students, along with others interested in programming, in taking
introductory computer science couses.

Shortly after I began work on this project, I was hired by the university to assist in the development of the real Practice-It and
so this project fell by the wayside.
